A helper script for board games' setup phases.

## Why?
This script was created for Raiders of the North Sea game. The game asks the player to randomize components using a bag. The 'Mead' components, however, are fairly large which makes picking them by random really difficult. Thus, one Saturday morning, I wrote a quick script.

The code should be fairly easy to modify to suit others games aswell.
